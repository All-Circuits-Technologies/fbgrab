requirements to build:
you need these on your system:
libpng 
libz   

to build:
run 
make

to install 
run 
make install

If you want to install to a different directory, use prefix flag like this:
make prefix=/opt install

Troubleshooting
If you don't realize how to install splint, remove that row from the Makefile.
You propably have the libs already installed but if not try to get the from your
distribution and secondly from:
zlib : http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ 
libpng : http://www.libpng.org/
